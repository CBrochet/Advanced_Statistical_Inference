# Advanced_Statistical_Inference

## Introduction
This repository contains the project I did for the [Advanced Statistical Inference Course](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/course/ASI-2018Spring) at [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/fr).

The file Instructions.pdf contains all the assignments.

## Summary
I worked with two datasets (MNIST and CIFAR10) and I implemented a Classification (Na√Øve Bayes classifier) and a Linear Regression (Bayesian linear regression).
